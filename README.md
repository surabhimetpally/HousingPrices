Analyzing Housing Prices and E-Commerce Trends Using R

Date: December 1, 2024
Project Overview

This project demonstrates my data analysis and predictive modeling skills using R. It covers two main analyses:

Housing Price Prediction using the Ames, Iowa housing dataset
E-commerce Data Analysis to uncover business insights
The project involves data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling, all executed with Râ€™s tidyverse package. Visualizations were created to communicate insights effectively and support data-driven decision-making.
