# HousingPrices
Analyzing Housing Prices and E-Commerce Trends Using R

Date: December 1, 2024
Project Overview

This project demonstrates my data analysis and predictive modeling skills using R. It covers two main analyses:

Housing Price Prediction using the Ames, Iowa housing dataset
E-commerce Data Analysis to uncover business insights
The project involves data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling, all executed with Râ€™s tidyverse package. Visualizations were created to communicate insights effectively and support data-driven decision-making.

Housing Price Prediction

Dataset: Ames, Iowa housing dataset

Cleaned and transformed data to prepare it for analysis.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing residential home prices.
Developed a linear regression model using features such as garage area and living area.
Achieved an R-squared value of 0.5978, indicating a strong predictive performance.
Visualized trends and relationships through scatter plots and summary statistics.
E-commerce Data Analysis

Dataset: E-commerce sales data

Conducted exploratory data analysis to answer critical business questions.
Calculated key metrics such as the average quantity of items sold per invoice and total sales across different countries.
Created visualizations (bar charts, scatter plots) to present findings clearly and effectively.
Technologies Used

R (tidyverse, ggplot2)
RStudio
Data Visualization: ggplot2
Project Highlights

Structured, iterative approach to data cleaning and feature engineering.
Developed robust predictive models for housing prices.
Delivered actionable insights for e-commerce data through visualization and analysis.
